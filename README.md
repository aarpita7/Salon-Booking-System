# **Salon Booking System Using Queue**

üöÄ **Project Overview**  
This project implements a **Salon Booking System** using the **Queue** data structure, developed with **Python** and **Tkinter**. The system efficiently handles customer appointments by maintaining a queue, ensuring that clients are served in the order they book. The project demonstrates the practical use of queues to streamline appointment management in real-world scenarios.

## **Features**
- **Queue-Based Booking**: Ensures that customers are served in a first-come, first-served order.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built using **Tkinter** to provide an intuitive interface for both customers and salon staff.
- **Efficient Management**: Organizes customer flow and reduces waiting time.
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted for any booking-based system.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Python**: Used for logic implementation and handling data structures.
- **Tkinter**: Provides a graphical interface to interact with the system.

## **Installation and Usage**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [GitHub Repository URL]
cd salon-booking-system
```


### **2. Run the System**
Execute the Python script to launch the Salon Booking System:
```bash
python salon_booking_system.py
```

---

## **How It Works**
The system uses the **Queue** data structure to manage customer bookings. Customers are added to the queue as they book appointments, and they are served in the order they entered the queue. The interface built using **Tkinter** allows users to:
- **Add new customers** to the queue
- **View current bookings**
- **Serve customers** in a first-come, first-served manner

---

## **Code Structure**
- `salon_booking_system.py`: The main file containing the logic for the queue and the Tkinter-based user interface.
